The program will ask user which function the user want to excute. 1 for encryption, 2 for decryption, 3 for generate key and 4 for distribution.

****Encryption****
1. After enter 1, the program will ask the path for the key. 
2. Afetr enter the path for key, the program will aks user for the path of the plain text.
3. After enater the path for plain text, the program will ask the path of the file where the user want to store the cipher text.

The result will show in terminal and write into the file where the user input above, and it will also display the running time for the encryption.

****Decryption****
1. After enter 2, the program will ask user for the path of key.
2. after enter the path of key, the program will aks user for the path of cipher text.
3. After enter the path of the cipher text, The program will aks for the path of file where the user want to store the result.

The result will be stored into the destnation file.

 
****Generate key****

1. Afetr enter 3, the program will ask user for the length of the key.
2. afetr enter the length, the program will ask user for the path where user want to store the key.

The result will be store to the destnation file.

****distribution****
After enter 4, the program will display the distribution of the 5000 3-bits key, with the key and the frequency of that key.
